# My First Website

This was my first project completed for the Code Institute. They required me to display three pages, with a navigation bar, that displayed logos of the technologies that we are using winthin the course.

## Improvements

We were asked to use the 'float' CSS property to create a grid of logos. However, I feel I could get better restults using 'flex box' to build my grid and present logos. This could easily be improoved further for mobile devices with some simple media queries. I also added an '.active' class to the current page to improove user experience.
